# To Do List
. Ether cross product
. Introduce correct reactive atom matching in trimolecular TSs
. Work out pure Mopac constraints
. SE refinement of ensembles
. Assess Hook+opt in yielding ok TSs (if/else blocks?)
. Assess if Gaussian is significatively faster than Mopac in POPT (Linux?)
. Resolve Calc_Energy Issue (error in .sdf bonds perception?) -> PM7 SP? -> Required?
. Generate input from TS geometry
. implement np_cache (low priority)
