# To Do List
. Ketone reactive_atoms class
. rewrite pumping into reactive atom classes as prop(self)
. Introduce correct reactive atom matching in trimolecular TSs
. Work out pure Mopac constraints
. SE refinement of ensembles
. Assess Hook+opt in yielding ok TSs (if/else blocks?)
. Assess if Gaussian is significatively faster than Mopac in POPT (Linux?)
. Resolve Calc_Energy Issue (error in .sdf bonds perception?) -> PM7 SP? -> Required?
. Generate input from TS geometry
. implement np_cache (low priority)
. what about (CH3OH)2CH3Br TS? not cyclical, just assisted...
