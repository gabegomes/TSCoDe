# To Do List

. optimize compenetration check (cython)
. does the new compenetration check always work? Seems so but check
. Introduce correct reactive atom matching in trimolecular TSs
. Work out pure Mopac constraints
. SE refinement of ensembles
. Assess Hook+opt in yielding ok TSs (if/else blocks?)
. Assess if Gaussian is significatively faster than Mopac in POPT (Linux?)
. Generate input from TS geometry
. specify generic orbital parameter in variables to use as a KeyError fallback
. cythonize linalg tools?
. what about (CH3OH)2CH3Br TS? not cyclical, just assisted...
. clean up hypermolecule class
<!-- . Resolve Calc_Energy Issue (error in .sdf bonds perception?) -> PM7 SP? -> Required? -->
