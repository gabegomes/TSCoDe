# Search constants

MAX_ANGLE = 20
# Maximum angle, in degrees, at which initial
# population and sequential steps can be
# rotated along x, y, or z axis

MAX_DIST = 0.5
# Maximum traslation, in angstroms, at which initial
# population and sequential steps can be
# rotated along x, y, or z axis

D_CLASH = 1.4
# minimum distance between atoms without clashes

K_SOFTNESS = 3
# if bigger, orbital overlap is more gradual and
# starts at bigger distances

SLOPE = 1
# Slope of scoring function
