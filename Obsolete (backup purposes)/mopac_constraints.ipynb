    "# Individual internal coordinates can be fixed in a Cartesian geometry optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "Because large molecule geometries are normally defined in Cartesian coordinates, it might seem difficult to lock individual bond-lengths or angles so that their values cannot be modified during the optimization.  The answer is to define individual atoms using internal coordinates.  Suppose that, in a large molecule, hydrogen atom 3000 needs to be defined as being 1.1 Å from oxygen atom 2999.  Then using a graphics package, locate H3000 and O2999, and two other atoms that could be used in defining the angle and dihedral in an internal coordinate connectivity.  Suitable atoms might be the atom O2999 is connected to (e.g. C2967) and the next atom (e.g. N2960).  Of course, any atoms could be used provided their atom-number is lower than the atom being defined, i.e. here lower than 3000.  Once the four atoms (here H3000, O2999, C2967, and N2960) are identified, work out the angle and dihedral.  Use these data in constructing the internal coordinate definition for H3000.   If the H3000-O2999-C2967 angle was 120°, and the H3000-O2999-C2967-N2960 torsion was 180°, then the position of the hydrogen atom with a fixed O-H distance would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "    H 1.1 0 120 1 180 1 2999 2976 2960\n",
    "\n",
    "If the angle needed to be fixed, then the line would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "    H 1.1 1 120 0 180 1 2999 2976 2960\n",
    "\n",
    "and so on.  There is no restriction on the number of internal coordinates that can be used.  Indeed, entire hetero groups can be defined as being rigid, but free to move within a cavity.  In such a case, the first atom in the hetero group would be defined in either unconstrained internal or Cartesian coordinates, the next atom would be in internal coordinates and have its bond-length fixed, the next atom would be internal coordinates and have a frozen bond length and angle, and all the remaining atoms in the hetero group would be in internal coordinates and have all coordinates frozen.\n",

    "Quite often, the geometry does not allow a bond-length or angle to be defined, because the atoms that would be used in the connectivity are defined after the atom of interest.  Fortunately, there is an easy way to solve this problem: the order of occurrence of Cartesian atoms is not important, so simply move the atoms to be used in the connectivity to before the atom whose bond length or angle is to be defined.  Alternatively, move the atom whose bond length or angle is to be defined to the end of the data set."
