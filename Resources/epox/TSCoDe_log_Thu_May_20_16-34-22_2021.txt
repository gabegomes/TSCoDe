Sorry, the program did not find any reasonable TS structure. Are you sure the input indexes were correct? If so, try these tips:
    - Enlarging the search space by specifying a larger "steps" value with the keyword STEPS=n
    - Imposing less strict rejection criteria with the DEEP or CLASHES keyword.
