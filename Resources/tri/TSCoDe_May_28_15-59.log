Discarded 2638 candidates for similarity (299 left, 125.45 s)

--> Checkpoint output - Wrote 299 TS structures to TSCoDe_checkpoint_May_28_15-59.xyz file before MM optimization.

--> Structure optimization (UFF level)
Openbabel UFF optimization took 319.08 s (~1.07 s per structure)
Successfully refined 187/299 candidates at UFF level. Non-refined structures are kept anyway.
Discarded 16 candidates for similarity (283 left, 7.24 s)

--> Checkpoint output - Updated 283 TS structures to TSCoDe_checkpoint_May_28_15-59.xyz file before MOPAC optimization.
