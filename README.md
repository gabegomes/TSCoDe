TSCoDe is the first systematical conformational embedder for bimolecular and trimolecular chemical reactions. It is able to generate a comprehensive set of both regioisomeric and stereoisomeric poses for molecular arrangements, provided the atoms that will be reacting. It supports both open and cyclical transition states. By feeding the program conformational ensembles, it also generates all conformations combinations. It is thought as a tool to explore TS conformational space in a fast and systematical way, and yield a series of starting points for higher-level calculations.

**NOTE: structures obtained from TSCoDe are not proper transition states (most of the times) but are often quite close. The program is intended to yield and rank poses, not TSs. In this way, the computational chemist can skip the error-prone phase of molecular embedding and proceed to the most appropriate higher-level calculation step.**

### Required packages and tools
TSCoDe is written mostly in Python, with some libraries optionally boosted via Cython. It leverages the numpy library to do the linear algebra required to translate and rotate molecules, and the [ASE](https://github.com/rosswhitfield/ase) environment to perform a set of manipulation on the provided structures through the [MOPAC2016](http://openmopac.net/MOPAC2016.html) calculator. While the former is free software, the latter is only free for academic use, and a license must be requested via the MOPAC website.

## What the program can do (well)
Create poses for bimolecular and trimolecular transition states of organic molecules. Reactive atoms supported are `CHONPS`. Reactions can be of three kinds:
- d

The program is 
 
  
  
  
### Keywords
- **SUPRAFAC** - Only retain suprafacial orbital configurations in cyclical TSs. Thought for Diels-Alder reactions.


- **DEEP** - Performs a deeper search, retaining more starting points for calculations and smaller turning angles. Equivalent to `THRESH=0.3 STEPS=12 CLASHES=(num=5, dist=1)`


- **NOOPT** - Skip the optimization steps, directly writing structures to file.

  

- **STEPS** - Manually specify the number of steps to be taken in scanning rotations. The standard value of 6 will perform six 60Â° turns. Syntax: `SCAN=n`, where n is an integer. **UPDATE**

  

- **BYPASS** - Debug keyword. Used to skip all pruning steps and directly output all the embedded geometries.

  

- **THRESH** - RMSD threshold (Angstroms) for structure pruning. The smaller, the more retained structures. Default is 0.5 A. Syntax: `THRESH=n`, where n is a number.

  

- **DIST** - Manually imposed distance between specified atom pairs, in Angstroms. Syntax uses parenthesis and commas: `DIST(a=2.345, b=3.67, c=2.1)`

  

- **CLASHES** - Manually specify the max number of clashes and the distance threshold at which two atoms are considered clashing. The more forgiving, the more structures will reach the geometry optimization step. Syntax: `CLASHES(num=3, dist=1.2)`

  

- **NEWBONDS** - Manually specify the maximum number of "new bonds" that a TS structure can have to be retained and not to be considered scrambled. Default is 1. Syntax: `NEWBONDS=1`

  

- **NEB** - Perform an automatical NEB TS search after the partial optimization step, inferring reagents and products. This option is only really usable for *associative* reactions, where two (or more) molecules are bound together (or strongly interacting) after the reaction, with no additional species involved. For example, cycloaddition reactions are great candidates while atom transfer reactions (*i.e.* epoxidations) are not.

  

- **LEVEL** - Manually set the MOPAC theory level to be used, default is PM7. Syntax: `LEVEL=PM7`

  

- **RIGID** - Avoid bending structures to better build TSs.

  

- **NONCI** - Avoid estimating and printing non-covalent interactions.

  

- **ONLYREFINED** - Discard structures that do not successfully refine bonding distances.

  

- **LET** - Overrides safety checks that prevent the program from running too large calculations.
